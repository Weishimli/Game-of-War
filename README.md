# Game of War

## Overview

This project simulates the classic card game "War" and is implemented in both Haskell and Elixir. It was developed as part of the CPS 506 project.

## Languages Used

- Haskell
- Elixir

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on implementation of the Game of War in functional programming languages. It serves as a project for the CPS 506 course.

## Features

- Simulates the Game of War with standard playing cards.
- Haskell and Elixir implementations for comparison.
- Provides an interactive and automated mode for playing.

## Project Structure

- `haskell/`: Contains Haskell implementation.
- `elixir/`: Contains Elixir implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Haskell compiler (GHC) for Haskell implementation.
- Elixir runtime for Elixir implementation.
